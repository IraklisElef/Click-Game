Mining clicker game where the player is outside at the beggining but as the game progresses he starts mining better materials. He starts off simple, like mining coal or other simple material, but later he reaches diamond or antimater for example. The game ends when he reaches the most valuable material like antimater. He can prestige his game which will lead in gaining better stats and make the overall game easier. He will be able to upgrade different stats based on the materials he mined. There will be a randomizer which will mine better materials even in earlier stages.
